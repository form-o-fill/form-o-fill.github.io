# Using workflows for multi page automation

Since version 2.0 Form-O-Fill has the ability to automate multi-page forms.  
This is what workflows are for.

Lets assume you want to buy something nice for your four year old daughter at amazon.  
Of cause it has to be something about unicorn.

Lets automate that:

- Go to amazon.com
- Search for unicorns
- Go to the details page of the first match
- Add the product to the shopping cart

For each step of the workflow we need a rule. At the end we will connect those rules to for the workflow.
