<p class="alert">
  <strong>Form-O-Fill was removed from the chrome store.</strong><br />
  The chrome store "team" has decided to remove Form-O-Fill from the store because it required too many and too broad
  permissions.<br />
  On 7th of march the extension was removed even though the permission were changed beforehand as required. Since it is
  impossible to get helpful information from the store "team" I decided to not publish this extension in the store
  anymore.<br />
  I'm sorry for those still using it but coping with the store system of allowing or disallowing extensions feels too
  tedious for now. The extension still works as expected if you build and install it locally.
  <br /><br />
  Follow
  <a href="https://github.com/form-o-fill/form-o-fill-chrome-extension/releases/tag/v4.0.0">these instructions</a> to
  install it locally if you want.
</p>
<p>
  Form-O-Fill is a programmable form filler for the Chrome Browser.
