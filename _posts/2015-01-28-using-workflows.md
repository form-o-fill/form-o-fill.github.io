# Using workflows for multi page automation

Since version 2.0 Form-O-Fill has the ability to automate multi-page forms.  
This is what workflows are for.

Lets assume you want to buy something nice for your four year old daughter at amazon.  
Of cause it has to be something with unicorn:

- Go to amazon.com
- Search for unicorny stuff
- Go to the details page of the first match
- Add the product to the shopping cart

For each step of the workflow we need a rule.
You can get the working rules - ready to be imported - [at this link](/downloads/fof-amazon-demo1-export.json).

Take a look at the rules and the workflows menu. Very easy to automate even the most complex actions.

Have fun using Form-O-Fill!
