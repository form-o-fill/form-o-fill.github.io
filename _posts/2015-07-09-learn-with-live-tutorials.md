# Learn Form-O-Fill with these live tutorials

It's been a long time since I posted something here but I have been busy implementing the newest Form-O-Fill feature:

The new [live tutorials](/tutorial) should make it easier to learn the usage of the extension step by step.

The goal is to add tutorials one by one until every feature Form-O-Fill has to offer has been covered.

Take a look at the [existing ones](/tutorial) I think they work pretty well.

## Help wanted!

If you can think of a good tutorial topic or think something is missing in the existing ones, please take a look at the [planned ones](https://github.com/form-o-fill/form-o-fill-chrome-extension/issues/52) and add your idea there or simply <a href="mailto:formofillextension@gmail.com">give me a call</a>. 
Thanks!
